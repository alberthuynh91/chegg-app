## Installation / Usage


Chegg App requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.14.2 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >=6.14.11 for installation. If you use an older version you can use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install the required version of `Node` and switch between them.

yarn install
